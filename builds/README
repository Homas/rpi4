    ################################################## builds

	NOTE: These builds are for the most part too stale now
          for my liking (unvalidated tweaks, app specific workarounds)
          They can break at any time and
          are provided to support legacy installs until
          they either don't build or what you need breaks :(


    WHAT-IS-IT?: disk images of openwrt for the rpi-4... see thread
                 or ../README for installation tips... based on
                 snapshot(master) they include;

                    -common drivers ( usb nic / lte / etc. )
                    -larger default partitions
                    -luci + luci-theme-argon
                    -applications
                    -some installation/setup tweaks and customisations

 
    IMAGE-TYPES:

        "sys" = sysupgrade
        "fac" = factory



      VARIANTS:

                 * 'extra/full' and
                 * 'std/basic/halffull' (periodic due to low demand)

             recommended to use the 'extra/full' as these will likely throw out
             the packagesrestore logic and there are no markers within the image
             re: variant... ( note: if you did a fresh install with the std/basic
             variant and always use this variant then above would not apply )



    ################################################ versioning notes
        
        r12345 = openwrt checkout revision
        1.x.x  = community version
        x.N.x  = community something major changed (vermagix, major patches for bcm2711 etc.)
        23456  = files revision
        



    
        any folder labelled beta,testing,unstable etc... can be ignored unless you are feeling
        lucky...

        upgrading on each (stable) release is not really beneficial unless you are feeling lucky,
        need a feature, are a power user or would like to help with testing / ironing out bugs...


        history seems to indicate that every 5-10 builds or so there are enough changes either to
        community package-set/features or official code to justify upgrading...
        or ~r15xxx(yourversion)

                +100-250(smallchanges especially for packages)
                +350-550(likely some target changes)
                +700+(fair amount of change and major bugfixes)

        however... on master a single commit can also change something important... build wise
        these kinds of changes generally are posted at the top of this document or on the
        forum thread... and where relavent build numbers are changed/or are labelled as test




    ################################################ supplimental file notes

            -diff-ing manifest across folders yields key package differences
            -../CHANGES contains terse notes on recent community additions and changes
            -packages.txt contains all "extra" added packages
            -rebuild.sh is a cmdline based imagebuilder rebuild command without 'files'
            -ibbuildinformation can be used also to rebuild or verify finer build details
