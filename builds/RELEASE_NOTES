        ##################################### RELEASE NOTES

        note: there is no ujail(added back r19003 removed post due to simple-adblock issue)
              or fw4 on the master builds
              (but I am happy to make one for you if you wish)





                ############################# r212xxx
                  -afaict argon theme is now broken?
                  -no more updatecheck bar at all :(
                  -dnsmasq(default variant?) on master now has no ipset support and
                   does not correctly identify/setup nftsets in parrallel support


                  -NOTE from subversion 5 we are testing FW4/NFTABLES please dont
                   install 'current' / master if you are unfamiliar with manually
                   verifying some fundamental functions on the command line
                   (firewall rules, services running etc.) at least for a week
                   or three...
 
                   While I am reasonably comfortable with general function... it's
                   edge cases or legacy logic we need to verify is up to chuff...




		############################# 22.03 + r20xxx untested > .7 tested a bit


      
            -note: ujail and seccomp crept back in on these builds although we've dabbled
                  with them on and i've endeavored to enable them somewhat, last build
                  had them off afaik as they effected https-dns-proxy's function

                  if this is the case, i'll use the testing 'flavour' for a build without
                  them unless there is more foundational issues with them.

                  apologies for not stating/noticing this earlier




           if luci login fails make sure to type "https://" at
           the start of url...

           FIXED-ISH MAYBE
           
           -sqm dual fw support broken -> workaround added but might effect
            anyone advanced trying to switch to nft manually (which a seperate
            image will be better for probably at this stage anyway given how often
            and varied packages break when altered for fw changes)
           
          -updatecheck bar (flash and msg is not functional > hotfix in progress)
          workaround for no flash button/link in updatecheck bar once logged in (subversions before 7)

```
sed -i 's/\!sysauth=\!/\!sysauth_https=\!/g' /bin/updatecheck.sh
```
edit 20221111 above probably not enough sadly...

may be some weeks if at all it comes back (without some help) ... i'm going to check stabe/release
to see if it's still working there first...

           
            TOFIX
           
           -20221111 getting disk full messages... likely something on my end maybe, need to
            look into if it's just versioned rubbish buildup or something more 'fast'
            is happening


           -possible acme changes/new workarounds needed
           -ipv6 wan connection on my link hits firstboot failsafe code
            (not coming up) afaik this has been an issue going back 7+months
            (to test more on non-firstboot as first step)
            NB: firstboot times are stretched an additional ~1+mins from this
                (albeit can use some attention anyway)
           -masq seems to have changed a bit a look like it needs some love which
            will likely need to be version specific


       ############################## 7.1.13 - k5.15test - r19686

            kernel was updated to 5.15 test build, i have to tested this yet so
            wait for a week / few days if you don't have dd backups or general
            confidence based on other sources...

            -uploaded as current but i'm aware of a few mostly minimal? places
             where my/our logix does not accomodate it... for this week its mostly
             for any brave souls whom are eager to test the new kernel and
             investigate core function / quirks / performance etc.


             a) on building kmod pwm was not available
             b) hmmm... userspace seems alot more snappy
             c) tailroom bug (rare) still present
             d) um... my additional usb mount is spitting errors on (last build)
                upgrade... looks like some sort of semi-newish brute ps kill
                / term... and probably not so big a deal for most?
                ... just noting here for a time reference...



       ############################## 5.7.50 - k113 - r19602
            -hmmm... I think this build http login fails(chrome) but https is ok...

       ############################## 5.7.31-x_r19345
            -uploaded as 'current'(>stable@05042022) flavour, i've limited time to test and
             unaware of any CVE so can't/shouldn't push this as 'stable'
             until a few users test/weeks pass to find bugs or issues
               -nft-qos 'rate' still not working
               -busybumped
               -5.10.109

       ############################## 5.7.9-x_r19171
            -openssl>1.1.1n CVE-2022-0778

       ############################## r19075/5.7.5-2~+
           -nft-qos rate no longer displays
            https://github.com/openwrt/luci/issues/5713
           -kernel 5.10 (master) prior to 5.10.103 (r19075ish) has dirtypipe cve
            priv-esc vuln (requires user / application access)
            (build r19075 has 5.10.103)





       ############################## docker user installation has issue
                         -for all docker packages due to conflict between
                          websockets-openssl(mosquitto) and
                          websockets-full(luci-app-dockerman<ttyd)
                          user is required to pass nodeps to opkg
                             > opkg install --nodeps luci-app-dockerman
                          (fyi all packages consume around 110M)



       ############################## https-dns-proxy and/or simple-adblock
                         -these services are known to be troublesome on
                          upgrade, you may need to login and manually
                          start/restart them and/or dnsmasq

       

       ############################### 20220303 remove 21.02.2 due to luci errors
                          -bugger can't trigger again... leave 23 up in devel for a bit more
                          -possible config > r19033 > 21.02.2 dg interaction
                           (diff factory)
                          -upg w argon selected?
                          -'release' only output?
                          -certain bannermsg?
                          -messed with cascade.css browser cache?
                          -half connected early browser cache?
                          -cmdline login before luci opened? (sysinfo)
                          -nb: dgd to 19 was still there something to do with
                               welcomeback strings

       ############################### r19xxx (19003 > 19039)
                         -likely 'current/testing or just devel' for a while due to re-enable
                          ujail and switch back to elf-dat current
                          probably only kick it to stable once r18xxx becomes truly stale
                             -simple-adblock issue reported with ujail removing procd-ujail
                              and procd-seccomp resolves
                         -also quite a few general logic tidying all over the place
                          could cause some fallout in unknown places


       ############################### r18913 or 21.02.2
                        -user reports of not being able to reboot
                         and/or odd issue with missing file?
                         use busybox reboot -f and wait for newer builds or
                         more diagnostic details

                         possible lead re monitor connection / fw / mailbox / et al
                         https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1559


       ############################### r18913
                        -minor CVE fix for tcpdump
                        -support for reboot_recovery if ROOTFSEXPAND_DATAPART= was
                         enabled on last/next upgrade




       ############################## possible pppoe ipv6 masq logspam @master


       ############################## bbr (5.0.77-7)
                          -switched congestion tcp to bbr for fun report issues
                           (afaik only really effects host based connections i.e.
                            local services)



       ##################################################### 5.1 fw4 notes: (manual install only)

                          -probably mwan(y)/vpn-pbr(ipsets)/banip(y) etc wont work
                           and firewall.user? which might mean miniupnpd or similar
                          -rpi4.qos seems ok in parallel mode
                          -although the upstream advice'
                           is to use wrapper, parallel is currently much better with
                           less breakage




        ##### some dnsmasq CVE affecting 21.01.1 not sure about master level ~medium
			  dependant upon exposure (topology)
			http://lists.openwrt.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2022-January/037717.html


        ##### ffmpeg glitch from ipkg meta on package restore
              if switching between release and master (with -R)
              can be ignored for now and likely no ill effects


        #####~ r18609   nothing special, still fw3 and kernel bumped to 5.10.92
                        fixed below CPUfreq issues

        #####~ r18531(again)



        ####################!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS BUILD (5.0.19) HAS CPUFREQ PROBLEMS JUMP BACK TO r18531/5.0.11
        #####~ r18609   nothing special, still fw3 and kernel bumped to 5.10.92
                        #edit: gpu-fwreverted(well users of CM4 specifically seeed boards if any
                         may wish to keep an eye on usb3 oddities moving forward)

              -9        remove ujail again... possibly some altservice (wwan) issues
                        https://forum.openwrt.org/t/rpi4-community-build/69998/1974?u=wulfy23
                        edit:nope but 600Mhz applies

              -23ish    flavour: stable revert to 5.0.11 / kernel 90 due to possible scaling issue and
                        also remove ujail while at it for simpler troubleshooting
                        short term

              -23ish    flavour: current r18609 with fixed fw



        #####~ r1853x+ has seeedstudio lan78xx kmod





        firewall.getZoneColorStyle is not a function - https://github.com/openwrt/luci/issues/5728
