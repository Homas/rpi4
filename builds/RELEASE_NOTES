        ##################################### RELEASE NOTES



          NOTE: UPGRADE PROCESS (at least for me) IS NOW TAKING QUITE A BIT LONGER
                SO PLEASE ALLOW AROUND 12MINS BEFORE COMING BACK/LOGGINGIN/CHECKING INTERNET
                ETC


		20231231 -> 23.05.2
		###################################### rpi4.64-23.05.2-29356-3.0.6-3-r23630-ext4-sys.img.gz
		Um... no time to maintain much but hate to leave stale images up so have to bite the
		bullet and push forward...

                Build is "as-is" for an option (nft) for others, likely mostly usable for those needing
                the usbboot features but that might be about it...


		NOTES:
			console (AMA1 > AMA2 or whatever) is instantiated differently so you'll
                        probably see some output errors about /dev/console not existing until
                        I fix ( or you can change your /boot/cmdline.txt andor /etc/inittab )

                        pulled alot of custom setup / migrate stuff out mostly for services
                        as i'm not up to date with them, still need to pull out sqm stuff
                        start with a fresh install maybe if unsure but upgrade mostly worked for me

                        removed luci-app-simpleadblock to make it build (package renamed? removed?)
                        (just the luci app...)




                ############################# rpi-4_22.03.5_2.1.17-10+ are 'testing' flavour
                   -larger image contains adguardhome and intended for testing with
                    ENABLED_SERVICES="... agh" in /root/wrt.ini

                    DO NOT INSTALL UNLESS YOU ARE ADVANCED



                ############################# master pbr include
                   -noticed a new firewall config include script related to pbr
                    its benign for now (need to check on downgrade) 


                ############################# rpi4.qos ipset cleanup
                    rpi-4_snapshot_7.1.93-17_r23001_extra+

                   -migration to and from master(nft) on prev master builds for anyone
                    using (or used in the past) rpi4.qos seems to have created a
                    sort of ipset migration race condition (my masq failed to start
                    all of a sudden (current master WITHOUT rpi4.qos running for
                    several boots

                    i've added ipset cleanup code to the build to try to prevent
                    masq issues / bloating of dhcp config
                    (well technically it should have cleaned this from the
                     beginning anyway)

                    while i'm hoping it does not trash any user ipsets that are
                    present let me know if this happens...

                    it may however cause a long "hang" (approx additional
                    120secs max) when stopping sqm or upgrading...
                    the first time it runs, apologies for this
                   


                    just to clarify / restate;
                       on MASTER: rpi4.qos is actually layer_cake (so sqm still starts)
                              (scraping will happen on next upgrade/firstboot)

                       on RELEASE: rpi4.qos is still there with scraping on sqm stop
                                   AND firstboot




                     -simple-adblock / https-dns-proxy here we go again, this time
                      just try to scrub dhcp config of these services prior to
                      and before firstboot
                        22.03.5-13+
                        r23001-7 plus




                ############################# r23001 snapshot nft beta / test / cleanup build
                   -HAVE NOT TESTED THIS YET > EDIT basic test
                   -RECOMMEND putting on an entirely separate SDCARD if you will be testing this
                   -BACKUP your banip(masq?/other?) config file if you are downgrading back to 22.x
                   -Also suggest switching off rpi4.qos if you are using it before upgrading

                   It has been some time since last master build. There were some changes in
                   fundamental package selections.
                 
                   Before cleaning it up more, good to have an image out there for various
                   carp / foundation issues to be known

                   1. It's bigger
                   2. Last time I tried master it was running fairly quick, i'd say a little
                      faster than 22.03.x but that's decent too will report back here anything
                      in this of note
                   3. No update to rpi bootstrap (elf/dat) has been made (yet)
                   4. Apparently wifi may be whacky on these boards of recent month(s)...
                      not planning on touching wifi but lets see how it fairs and is
                      a good point of comparison with 22.x
                       edit: afaik maybe got better after this around late may

                   5. interesting delay for wan carrier could be from me using kickanic,
                      docsis update, netifd or similar 30-50 secs hang after nic
                      renamed to lan bringup... can live with but kinda hefty in context
                       edit: hmmm... actually watching the wan usb nic coming up
                             seems like it could be coming up earlier also possibly
                             and HFC modem going into reset because of something
                             local / changing the MAC late?
                      

                      * stage2 custom info was not visible... likely a 22.03.5 thing?... 
                          or my serial stuff which seemed a little off too...


                ############################# 23.03.5
                   -um... rev5 general function ok
                    a few app things creeping in maybe
                    of note: update base is there but not flash link

                ############################# 23.03.3
                   -as im not really running / tracking this branch much key
                    application / application config changes or other
                    may take time to surface (please report!)

                   -vpn-policy-routing > pbr
                    you'll need to update/change your config/ENABLED_SERVICES
                    if you use this service, as yet i'm not auto handling this
                    due to unknown complexities with config migration
                    if app handles(config migration) let me know and i'll try to add some logic
                    for the service autostart fixup

                    IF YOU RUN THIS SERVICE suggest putting config file in place or checking if
                    its automigrated before updating... and update your ENABLED_SERVICES with 'pbr'
                    before upgrading

                    (app name change midrelease is kinda odd)



                ############################# r212xxx
                  -afaict argon theme is now broken?
                  -no more updatecheck bar at all :(
                  -dnsmasq(default variant?) on master now has no ipset support and
                   does not correctly identify/setup nftsets in parrallel support


                  -NOTE from subversion 5 we are testing FW4/NFTABLES please dont
                   install 'current' / master if you are unfamiliar with manually
                   verifying some fundamental functions on the command line
                   (firewall rules, services running etc.) at least for a week
                   or three...
 
                   While I am reasonably comfortable with general function... it's
                   edge cases or legacy logic we need to verify is up to chuff...

        note: there is no ujail(added back r19003 removed post due to simple-adblock issue)
              or fw4 on the master builds
              (but I am happy to make one for you if you wish)












		############################# 22.03 + r20xxx untested > .7 tested a bit


      
            -note: ujail and seccomp crept back in on these builds although we've dabbled
                  with them on and i've endeavored to enable them somewhat, last build
                  had them off afaik as they effected https-dns-proxy's function

                  if this is the case, i'll use the testing 'flavour' for a build without
                  them unless there is more foundational issues with them.

                  apologies for not stating/noticing this earlier




           if luci login fails make sure to type "https://" at
           the start of url...

           FIXED-ISH MAYBE
           
           -sqm dual fw support broken -> workaround added but might effect
            anyone advanced trying to switch to nft manually (which a seperate
            image will be better for probably at this stage anyway given how often
            and varied packages break when altered for fw changes)
           
          -updatecheck bar (flash and msg is not functional > hotfix in progress)
          workaround for no flash button/link in updatecheck bar once logged in (subversions before 7)

edit 20221111 above probably not enough sadly...

may be some weeks if at all it comes back (without some help) ... i'm going to check stabe/release
to see if it's still working there first...

           
            TOFIX
           
           -20221111 getting disk full messages... likely something on my end maybe, need to
            look into if it's just versioned rubbish buildup or something more 'fast'
            is happening


           -possible acme changes/new workarounds needed
           -ipv6 wan connection on my link hits firstboot failsafe code
            (not coming up) afaik this has been an issue going back 7+months
            (to test more on non-firstboot as first step)
            NB: firstboot times are stretched an additional ~1+mins from this
                (albeit can use some attention anyway)
           -masq seems to have changed a bit a look like it needs some love which
            will likely need to be version specific


       ############################## 7.1.13 - k5.15test - r19686

            kernel was updated to 5.15 test build, i have to tested this yet so
            wait for a week / few days if you don't have dd backups or general
            confidence based on other sources...

            -uploaded as current but i'm aware of a few mostly minimal? places
             where my/our logix does not accomodate it... for this week its mostly
             for any brave souls whom are eager to test the new kernel and
             investigate core function / quirks / performance etc.


             a) on building kmod pwm was not available
             b) hmmm... userspace seems alot more snappy
             c) tailroom bug (rare) still present
             d) um... my additional usb mount is spitting errors on (last build)
                upgrade... looks like some sort of semi-newish brute ps kill
                / term... and probably not so big a deal for most?
                ... just noting here for a time reference...

                           is to use wrapper, parallel is currently much better with
